<p>In this example, the image will float to the right in the paragraph, and the text in the paragraph will wrap around the image.</p>

<p><img src="Leaf.jpg" alt="Leaf" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
This is my leaf picture. It is my desktop wallpaper. I like it because it adds color, but still has a neutral feel to it. I like neutral colors because they make me feel calm and they look clean.</p>
