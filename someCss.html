<h3>This is my first paragraph. I am currently at home in quarantine and I really miss going outside. I miss the UW campus and seeing my friends everyday. I hope I can see them again during the summer. I think I am going to use Courier New font for this paragraph.</h3>
<h4>This is second paragraph. I have been baking a lot of bread in quarantine. I like to try a new one every week. This week I made my favorite one yet, a rustic loaf. I used a dutch oven to make it crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I highly recommend trying to make it. I think I am going to use Helvetica font for this paragraph.</h4> 
<h5>This is my floated element</h5>

This is a picture of Paris. It is one of my favorite cities to visit. I have never been when it was snowing, but I think it would be very beautiful. I wish I was there instead of stuck in quarantine</p>
